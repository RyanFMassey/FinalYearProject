# FinalYearProject
My final year project.

This project is a proof-of-concept damage calculator for the MOBA Smite. Users can select their character, their items, their opponent,
their opponents items and the moves being used. The damage dealt is then calculated and output to the user. The calculator takes into
account the cooldowns of the moves and additional factors that can affect a moves damage, such as the number of ticks in a damage over
time attack.

The app has also been deployed to the Google App Engine and can be visited at: smitedamageappv2.appspot.com
